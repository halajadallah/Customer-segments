# Customer-segments
Part of Udacity machine learning nano degree program. This projects is on unsupervised learning.

The goal of the project is to use a suitable unsupervised learning algorithm to segment customers based on their spending habits
on six product categories. We start by data exploration and outlier detection. The data is right skewed and requires some 
symmetrization. For this we apply log-transformation. Next we use principal components for dimension reduction and visualization. 
Finally we apply clustering algorithm and clustering index to identify the best number of clusters to segment the customers. 

The data turns out to have the customers already labeled. This allows us to compare the clustering algorithm outcome with the 
real data.
